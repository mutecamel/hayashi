#### Review Question 1.3.3 (What Gauss-Markov does not mean)

Under Assumptions 1.1–1.4, does there exist a linear, but not necessarily unbiased, estimator of $$ \boldsymbol{\beta} $$ that has a variance smaller than that of the OLS estimator? If so, how small can the variance be?

##### Solution

If an estimator of $$ \boldsymbol{\beta} $$ is a constant, then the estimator is trivially linear in $$ \mathbf{y} $$.
