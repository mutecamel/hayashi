#### Review Question 1.2.2

Verify that $$ \mathbf{X}' \mathbf{X} / n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i \mathbf{x}_i \mathbf{x}_i' $$ and $$ \mathbf{X}' \mathbf{y} / n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i \mathbf{x}_i y_i $$.

##### Solution

By the [outer-way](../../reference/la/matmul.md) matrix multiplication rule, noticing that $$ \mathbf{x}_i $$ is the $$ i $$th column vector of $$ \mathbf{X}' $$, above equations are obviously true.
