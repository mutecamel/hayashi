### Section 4 Hypothesis Testing under Normality

#### Review Question 1.4.1 (Conditionial vs. unconditional distribution)

(a) Do we know from Assumptions 1.1—1.5 that the marginal (unconditional) distribution of $$ \mathbf{b} $$ is normal?

(b) Are the statistics $$ z_k $$, $$ t_k $$, and $$ F $$ distributed independently of $$ \mathbf{X} $$?

##### Solution

(a) Under Assumptions 1.1—1.5,

$$
\mathbf{b} | \mathbf{X} \sim
N( \boldsymbol{\beta}, \sigma^2 \cdot ( \mathbf{X}' \mathbf{X} )^{-1} ).
\tag{1.4.2}
$$

Because the variance of $$ \mathbf{b} $$ depends on $$ \mathbf{X} $$, when the marginal distribution of $$ \mathbf{X} $$ is unknown,  the marginal distribution of $$ \mathbf{b} $$ is also unknown, so it is not necessarily normal.

(b) Under Assumptions 1.1—1.5 and the null hypothesis,

$$
\begin{align}
z_k | \mathbf{X} & \sim N(0, 1),
\tag{1.4.3}
\\
t_k | \mathbf{X} & \sim t(n - K),
\tag{1.4.5}
\\
F | \mathbf{X} & \sim F(\#r, n - K).
\tag{1.4.9}
\end{align}
$$

These _conditional_ distributions does not depend on the value of $$ \mathbf{X} $$, so their _marginal_ distributions are independent of $$ \mathbf{X} $$.
