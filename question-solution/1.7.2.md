#### Review Question 1.7.2 (Change of units)

In Nerlove's data, output is measured in kilowatt hours. If output were measured in megawatt hours, how would the estimated restricted regression change?

##### Solution

In the restricted regression

$$
\log \left( \frac{ TC_i }{ p_{i3} } \right) =
\beta_1 + \beta_2 \log ( Q_i ) + \beta_3 \log
\left( \frac{ p_{i1} }{ p_{i3} } \right) + \beta_4 \log
\left( \frac{ p_{i2} }{ p_{i3} } \right) +
\varepsilon_i,
\tag{1.7.6}
$$

if output measured in kilowatt hours ($$Q_i$$) is substituted by output measured in megawatt hours ($$ Q'_i \equiv Q_i / 1000 $$),

$$
\begin{align}
\log \left( \frac{ TC_i }{ p_{i3} } \right) & =
\beta_1 + \beta_2 \log ( 1000 \cdot Q'_i ) + \beta_3 \log
\left( \frac{ p_{i1} }{ p_{i3} } \right) + \beta_4 \log
\left( \frac{ p_{i2} }{ p_{i3} } \right) +
\varepsilon_i
\\ & =
( \beta_1 + \beta_2 \log (1000) ) +
\beta_2 \log ( Q'_i ) + \beta_3 \log
\left( \frac{ p_{i1} }{ p_{i3} } \right) + \beta_4 \log
\left( \frac{ p_{i2} }{ p_{i3} } \right) +
\varepsilon_i,
\end{align}
$$

then the estimated values of slopes ($$ \beta_2 $$, $$ \beta_3 $$ and $$ \beta_4 $$) will not change, but the estimated value of the intercept ($$ \beta_1 $$) will increase by $$ \hat{\beta}_2 \log (1000) $$.
