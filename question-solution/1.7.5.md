#### Review Question 1.7.5

If you take $$p_{i2}$$ instead of $$p_{i3}$$ and subtract $$ \log (p_{i2}) $$ from both sides of

$$
\log ( TC_i ) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \log ( Q_i ) + \beta_3 \log ( p_{i1} ) + \beta_4 \log ( p_{i2} ) + \beta_5 \log ( p_{i3} ) + \varepsilon_i,
\tag{1.7.4}
$$

how does the restricted regression look? Without actually estimating it on Nerlove's data, can you tell from the estimated  restricted regression in the text what the restricted OLS estimate of $$ ( \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_5 ) $$ will be? Their standard errors? the $$SSR$$? What about the $$R^2$$?

##### Solution

The new restricted regression will be

$$
\log \left( \frac{ TC_i }{ p_{i2} } \right) = \beta_1 +
\beta_2 \log ( Q_i ) +
\beta_3 \log \left( \frac{ p_{i1} }{ p_{i2} } \right) +
\beta_5 \log \left( \frac{ p_{i3} }{ p_{i2} } \right) +
\varepsilon_i.
\tag{1}
$$

The OLS estimate from regression on (1) should yield the same point estimate and standard errors. The $$SSR$$ should be the same, but $$R^2$$ should be different.
